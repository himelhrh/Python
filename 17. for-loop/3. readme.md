Print each fruit in a fruit list:

fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for x in fruits:
  print(x)
```
```
Loop through the letters in the word "banana":

for x in "banana":
  print(x)
```
```
Exit the loop when x is "banana":

fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for x in fruits:
  print(x)
  if x == "banana":
    break
```
```
Exit the loop when x is "banana", but this time the break comes before the print:

fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for x in fruits:
  if x == "banana":
    break
  print(x)
```
```
Do not print banana:

fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for x in fruits:
  if x == "banana":
    continue
  print(x)
```
```
The range() function returns a sequence of numbers, starting from 0 by default, and increments by 1 (by default), and ends at a specified number.

Example
Using the range() function:

for x in range(6):
  print(x)
Note that range(6) is not the values of 0 to 6, but the values 0 to 5.
```
```
range(2, 6), which means values from 2 to 6 (but not including 6):

Example
Using the start parameter:

for x in range(2, 6):
  print(x)
```
```
Increment the sequence with 3 (default is 1):

for x in range(2, 30, 3):
  print(x)
```
```
Print all numbers from 0 to 5, and print a message when the loop has ended:

for x in range(6):
  print(x)
else:
  print("Finally finished!")
```
```
for x in range(6):
  if x == 3: break
  print(x)
else:
  print("Finally finished!")

#If the loop breaks, the else block is not executed.
```
```
for x in [0, 1, 2]:
  pass

# having an empty for loop like this, would raise an error without the pass statement
```
