```
class MyClass:
  x = 5

p1 = MyClass()
print(p1.x)
```
```
class Person: 
    def __init__(self, name, age): 
        self.name = name 
        self.age = age 

ob = Person("kibria", 22)
print(ob.name) 
print(ob.age) 
```
```
Insert a function that prints a greeting, and execute it on the p1 object:

class Person:
  def __init__(self, name, age):
    self.name = name
    self.age = age

  def myfunc(self):
    print("Hello my name is " + self.name)

p1 = Person("John", 36)
p1.myfunc()
```
```
The self Parameter
The self parameter is a reference to the current instance of the class, and is used to access variables that belongs to the class.

It does not have to be named self , you can call it whatever you like, but it has to be the first parameter of any function in the class:
class Person: 
    def __init__(this, name, age): 
        this.name = name 
        this.age = age 
    def func(this): 
        print("My name is: ", this.name) 
ob = Person("kibria", 22)
print(ob.name) 
print(ob.age) 
ob.func()
```
```
modify object property
class Person:
  def __init__(self, name, age):
    self.name = name
    self.age = age

  def myfunc(self):
    print("Hello my name is " + self.name)

p1 = Person("John", 36)

p1.age = 40
#del p1.age delete object property
#del p1 delete object
print(p1.age)
```
```
The pass Statement
class definitions cannot be empty, but if you for some reason have a class definition with no content, put in the pass statement to avoid getting an error.

Example
class Person:
  pass
```
